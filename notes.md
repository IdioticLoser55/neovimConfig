# Things to do

## Fonts
- figure out ligatures.
- devicons
- nerdfont's

## Keybindings
- Pick a propper mapleader.
- Figure out keybindings.


## Formatters and Linters
- Figuer out what formatters and linters you want.

- https://github.com/jay-babu/mason-null-ls.nvim
    - Use this to add ensure_install functionality for formatters.
    - And Linters.

## Rust
- https://rsdlt.github.io/posts/rust-nvim-ide-guide-walkthrough-development-debug/
- Probably want to try and figure out how to do this with null_ls

## Plugins
- Really look into telescope, treesitter.
- Look into mini.nvim. Might replace telescope and some other plugins.
    - Figure out what "text-objects" are.

- Once you've got a basic setup you really need to go through and figure out all the plugins you actually want to use.

        - Ranger / rnvimr

- fzf. And actually use it.

- ack. Better for searching than just /

- gitgutter. Used to keep track of what lines have changed and what haven't.
    Will need to compare this with whatever you're using at the moment.
    Think its coming from coc.


- Tag List. Opens up a side window with all the variables and methods.
