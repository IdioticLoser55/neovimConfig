# Things to do
- add plugin vim-rainbow. Makes keeping track of brackets easier.

- lightline/powerline one or the other. Basically plugins that actually do something useful with the bottom bar.

- Get a proper colourscheme working.

- fzf. And actually use it.

- ack. Better for searching than just /

- gitgutter. Used to keep track of what lines have changed and what haven't.
    Will need to compare this with whatever you're using at the moment.
    Think its coming from coc.


- Tag List. Opens up a side window with all the variables and methods.

- Fonts
    - figure out ligatures.
    - devicons
    - nerdfont's

- Pick a propper mapleader.
- Really look into telescope, treesitter.
- Look into mini.nvim. Might replace telescope and some other plugins.
    - Figure out what "text-objects" are.

- Figure out keybindings.

- Once you've got a basic setup you really need to go through and figure out all the plugins you actually want to use.
    - FileExplorer
        - Ranger / rnvimr
        - Nerdtree
        - Fern.vim
        - Vim-dirvish
        - nvim-tree.lua
        - tree.nvim
        - chadTree
        - telescope-file-browser.nvim

        - Telescope

# Terminal Ideas

- Colourtheme should be controlled by the shell.
